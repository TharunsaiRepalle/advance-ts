# pick:
    Pick allows you to create a new type by selecting a set of properties
    from the exisiting type.

    Eg: [a link](./src/pick.ts)

# Partial:
    Partial makes all properties of a type optimal, creating a type with same properties, but each marked as optional.
    Specifically useful when you want to do updates. 
    Eg: [a link](./src/partial.ts)

# Readonly:
    When you have a configuration object that should not be altered after initialization,making it Readonly ensures its properties cannot be changed.
    Eg: [a link](./src/readOnly.ts)

# Record and Map:
    Record and maps let's you give a cleaner type to objects.
    Eg: [a link](./src/record.ts)

    Map gives you an even fancier way to deal with objects. very similar to c++.
    Eg: [a link](./src/map.ts)

# Exclude:
    In a function that can accept several types of inputs but you want to exclude specific types from besing passed to it.
